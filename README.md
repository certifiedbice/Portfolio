### Hello I'm Bice

I am a web developer with an industry history.
I have a wide spread depth of knowledge in many areas of development and design.
I began designing websites in 1998 and over the years have progressed into development.

### I currently reside in Denver Colorado

I have worked around the country as a professional consultant for many years.
Much of that time was spent in the Silicon Valley back in the glory days of the early tech industry.

### My area of expertise

I have extensive experience and knowledge in most areas of art, design and development.
I have solid experience in server administration, am a Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician, and hold a CompTIA A+ certification as well.
I have years of experience in many areas of web design and development, working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and more.

### Why consider me

Aside from my large variety of skills, I bring a proven resourcefulness that can only be gained through experience.
Skills can be learned quickly in today's world, but a well rounded amount of experience is the only thing that is going to ensure those skills are applied effectively.

## About

In a ![Walnut](https://certifiedbice.github.io/portfolio/imgs/walnut.png) I am a diverse professional

I have lived a non-linear life trajectory and from that I have gained wisdom and experience in many areas.
One constant has been my life's entanglement with web technology. I am a geek and have a great passion for technology, I only wish I could learn it all.

When I am not designing or developing you will find me working on a painting or running a marathon or possibly helping develop leaders for the future.

My life story is far to long to squeeze in here so if you want to know, email me: certifiedbice@gmail.com.

What I can tell you about myself is that I have a strong desire and drive to bring my abilities to a team that will allow me to grow and make a difference.

I want my experience and training to be a benefit to my team and my project, I want to work in a place where my efforts will be felt and appreciated.

Ideally, I want to employ my talents in an environment where I can be challenged and learn from my teammates so that I can grow as a developer.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
